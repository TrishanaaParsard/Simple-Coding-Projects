<h1>Generating Magic Square</h1>

This C# code generates and rotates a magic square of odd order n (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc.). A magic square is a square grid filled with distinct positive integers in such a way that the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

Let's break down the code:

The ProblemALG004r class represents the magic square problem.

Constructor:

It takes two parameters: n (dimension of the square) and rotation (rotation of the square).
Initializes n, rotation, and magicSquare array.
Calls GenerateMagicSquare() method to generate the magic square.
GenerateMagicSquare() method:

Fills the magic square using the Siamese method (also known as the De la Loub√®re method).
Starts filling from the middle of the first row.
Moves diagonally up and to the right to place the next number.
Handles wrapping around the edges by checking if the next cell is already filled. If it is, moves down instead.
Rotate() method:

Creates a new array rotatedSquare to store the rotated magic square.
Depending on the rotation value, it rotates the square clockwise 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
Copies the elements of magicSquare to rotatedSquare according to the rotation.
Assigns rotatedSquare back to magicSquare.
PrintMagicSquare() method:

Prints the magic square to the console.
Main() method:

Initializes n and rotation (size and rotation of the magic square).
Creates an instance of ProblemALG004r with the specified n and rotation.
Calls PrintMagicSquare() to print the generated magic square.
To use this code, you can adjust the values of n and rotation in the Main() method according to your requirements and then execute the program to generate and print the desired magic square.
