<h1>Print a Diamond </h1>

This C# code prompts the user to input the size of a shape (which should be between 2 and 9), as well as the x and y coordinates of the center of the shape (within specified ranges). After validating the input, it constructs a two-dimensional array representing a grid of characters. Then, it marks the center of the shape with a '$' symbol in the grid.

Subsequently, it calculates the boundaries of the shape based on the provided size and center coordinates and marks the corners of the shape with '$' symbols in the grid.

Finally, it prints out the resulting grid, creating a diamond shape with the center specified by the user and its size determined by the input. The diamond shape is represented by '$' symbols. The grid has a size of 26 rows and 80 columns, with certain lines (every tenth line or column) marked with '=' symbols for visual reference.
